# Project Requirements:
# The script should be executed from within the project directory, not from outside.
# The project directory must contain:
#  - A `.version` file, which should define the `VERSION` variable and a `FILES` variable with comma-separated paths to files that should be uploaded.
#  - `.csproj` files (C# project files) to update version information in the version tag.
#  - A `Program.cs` file that contains a line to update a version string (e.g., `private static readonly string version = "X.X.X";`).
#  - Git initialized in the project directory (repository should be initialized with `git init`).
#  - A valid `RELEASE.md` file (optional, for release notes). If this file is present, the script will use it for creating release notes.
# The project should be a .NET-based project (as indicated by the `dotnet publish` commands).
# GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed to create GitHub releases.
# The script expects the project to be self-contained, building for both `linux-x64` and `win-x64` runtimes.
